# gos-simulator
Simulation of Lorenz's gosling experiment. 

This is my computer science A-level project. I've had no prior experience with Unity and C# before, this is my first foray into it. 

I was inspired to do this when taking psychology during my first year of A-Levels. I dropped it the year after, but I learnt a lot when I was studying it.

At some point I might come back to tackle this properly.
